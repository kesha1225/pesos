    <h1 style="text-align: center">PESOS (PS): Whitepaper</h1>

    <h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
    <p>PESOS (PS) is not a currency. It is a code. A mark of those who move. It cannot be bought, it cannot be exchanged for fiat. It must be earned, and it can be lost.</p>
    <p>Transactions are fast. Control is zero. The economy exists where no one expected it.</p>
    <p>PESOS is access, artifacts, barter. A gateway to what cannot be purchased. It is not a store of value, but an instrument of influence.</p>

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <b>Blockchain:</b> TON<br>
    <b>Ticker:</b> PS<br>
    <b>Precision:</b> 2 decimal places<br>
    <b>Governance:</b> None<br>
    <b>Issuance:</b> Through action, not purchase<br><br>
    Numbers are not what matters. What stands behind them is.<br>

    <h2>Economy</h2>
    <p>PESOS is designed for an internal system where value is determined not by the market, but by the movement itself. It circulates through those who understand.</p>

    <h3>Ways to acquire PESOS:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Earned through contributions to the movement.</li>
        <li>Received as recognition from those who already hold it.</li>
        <li>Transferred within the network as part of internal agreements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ways to spend PESOS:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Access to closed events, knowledge, and discussions.</li>
        <li>Unique items and artifacts that cannot be obtained otherwise.</li>
        <li>Transactions between trusted members of the network.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>PESOS is not a speculative asset. It is a tool for trust, access, and influence. It is a mechanism for proving one’s place in the movement.</p>
    <p>Ownership of PESOS is not about wealth. It is about <strong>belonging</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Distribution</h2>
    <p>PESOS is not freely issued. Every token in circulation is backed by action. To hold PESOS means to have contributed, to have taken part.</p>
    <p>There is no mining. There is no pre-mint. There is only proof of presence.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>PESOS (PS) is a system of value beyond money. A ledger of trust. Not a financial asset, but a key to what exists <strong>beyond the ordinary</strong>.</p>
    <p>The question is not how much PESOS you have. The question is — <strong>what you do with it</strong>.</p>
